# Product Sales Analysis by Country and Gender

## Introduction

This project aims to analyze the sales data of a company's products based on the number of products bought and the number of products sold, categorized by country and gender. The analysis provides valuable insights into the company's sales performance across different regions and genders, helping in strategic decision-making and resource allocation.

## Data Source

The data used for this analysis is sourced from the kaggle sales database. It includes information on the number of products bought and sold, as well as the associated country and gender of the buyers.

## Analysis Steps

The analysis involves the following steps:

1. **Data Extraction:** The sales data is extracted from the company's database and loaded into a suitable format for analysis. This can be achieved by running the data extraction script (`extract_data.py`).

2. **Data Cleaning:** The extracted data may contain errors, missing values, or inconsistencies. The data cleaning script (`clean_data.py`) is used to preprocess the data and ensure its quality and integrity.

3. **Data Analysis:** Once the data is cleaned, the main analysis script (`analyze_data.py`) is executed to calculate the number of products sold based on the number of products bought, categorized by country and gender. The script generates a detailed report (`analysis_report.csv`) containing the analyzed data.

4. **Visualization:** The visualization script (`visualize_data.py`) can be executed to generate visual representations of the analyzed data, such as bar charts, pie charts, or histograms. The resulting visualizations are saved as image files (`charts/` directory).

5. **Reporting:** Finally, the analysis report (`analysis_report.csv`) and the generated visualizations are compiled into a comprehensive README file (`README.md`), providing a clear overview of the findings, insights, and conclusions.

## Requirements

To run the analysis scripts, the following software and libraries are required:

- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- Matplotlib

## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/product-sales-analysis.git
   ```

2. Ensure that Python 3.x is installed on your system.

3. Install the required libraries by running the following command:

   ```
   pip install pandas matplotlib
   ```

4. Place the sales data file (`sales_data.csv`) in the project directory.

5. Run the data extraction script to extract the sales data:

   ```
   python extract_data.py
   ```

6. Run the data cleaning script to preprocess the data:

   ```
   python clean_data.py
   ```

7. Execute the main analysis script to calculate the number of products sold:

   ```
   python analyze_data.py
   ```

8. Run the visualization script to generate visualizations:

   ```
   python visualize_data.py
   ```

9. Review the analysis report (`analysis_report.csv`) and the visualizations saved in the `charts/` directory.

10. Update the README file (`README.md`) with the latest findings, insights, and conclusions.

11. Commit and push the changes to your GitHub repository.

   ```
   git add .
   git commit -m "Added analysis report and visualizations"
   git push origin master
   ```

## Conclusion

By following the steps outlined in this project, we were able to analyze the sales data by country and gender, providing valuable insights into the company's sales performance. The analysis report and visualizations can guide strategic decision-making and resource allocation, ultimately leading to improved sales and business growth.
